The second-most dangerous neurological 
condition, Parkinson's disease (PD), has a history of 
lowering people's quality of life (QOL). Parkinson's disease is 
a neurological condition that worsens over time, caused by 
the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra. It is characterized by slow movements, tremors, 
rigidity in the limbs, and changes in gait such as an 
abnormal forward-leaning posture, a shuffling gait, a 
tendency to take small rapid steps, difficulty initiating 
movement, and a higher risk of losing balance and falling. 
However, the initial symptoms of Parkinson's disease may be 
subtle and easily missed, leading to a delayed diagnosis 
after significant neuronal damage has already occurred.
